# Datasets

## With multiple concepts

### CelebA

**Link**: [Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/html/Liu_Deep_Learning_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.html)

**Short Description**: The dataset contains images of celebrities, annotated with 40 attributes (concepts), along with landmarks and bounding boxes (irrelevant for the concept detection task). The dataset is **super** popular for various tasks in machine learning, like segmentation, image generation, bias detection, etc. Notably, it has no explicit classes for the classification task. However, one can use any of the 40 attributes for classification.

**Volume metrics**: Number of images: 202,599; number of unique persons: 10,177 celebrities; number of concepts: 40 per image

**Concepts available**: `bald`, `no beard`, `mustache`, `chubby`, `smiling`, `attractive`, etc. *A known issue* is that some concepts are arbitrary (e.g., `young`, `attractive`) or mislabeled. The methodology of labelling is not clear. The full list is provided below.

| Attribute | Description | Attribute | Description |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 5_o_Clock_Shadow | Visible beard shadow | Goatee | Goatee beard |
| Arched_Eyebrows | Eyebrows arched upward | Gray_Hair | Gray hair color |
| Attractive | Subject perceived as attractive | Heavy_Makeup | Noticeable makeup |
| Bags_Under_Eyes | Visible under-eye bags | High_Cheekbones | Prominent cheekbones |
| Bald | No hair on scalp | Male | Male gender |
| Bangs | Hair covering forehead | Mouth_Slightly_Open | Mouth slightly open |
| Big_Lips | Relatively large lips | Mustache | Mustache present |
| Big_Nose | Relatively large nose | Narrow_Eyes | Narrow eye shape |
| Black_Hair | Black hair color | No_Beard | No facial hair |
| Blond_Hair | Blond hair color | Oval_Face | Oval face shape |
| Blurry | Image is blurry | Pale_Skin | Light/pale skin tone |
| Brown_Hair | Brown hair color | Pointy_Nose | Sharp nose shape |
| Bushy_Eyebrows | Thick eyebrows | Receding_Hairline | Hairline receding |
| Chubby | Full/round face | Rosy_Cheeks | Pinkish cheeks |
| Double_Chin | Visible double chin | Sideburns | Sideburn facial hair |
| Eyeglasses | Wearing eyeglasses | Smiling | Subject smiling |
| Wearing_Earrings | Wearing earrings | Straight_Hair | Straight hair texture |
| Wearing_Hat | Wearing a hat | Wavy_Hair | Wavy hair texture |
| Wearing_Lipstick | Wearing lipstick | Wearing_Necklace | Wearing necklace |
| Wearing_Necktie | Wearing necktie | Young | Subject appears young |

**Why is it relevant?**: Concepts are self-explanatory and do not require an expert's knowledge to state hypotheses about their relations. It is used almost everywhere in computer vision research as a good benchmarking standard. **Hypothesis to be evaluated**:

- Do `no beard` and `goatee`, etc., are truly hierarchical? Can we do better CAVs for these concepts?
- Are there other relations of concepts? E.g., `heavy makeup` and `lipstick` should be related
- CelebA is known for its biases (e.g., one of the genders has typically blonde hair). Can we remove them?

**Known biases**:

1. models tend to predict blonde people as women ([link to paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/2ecc80084c96cc25b11b0ab995c25f47-Abstract-Conference.html))
2. models tend to predict smiling based on gender ([link to paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Distributionally_Generative_Augmentation_for_Fair_Facial_Attribute_Classification_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf))

**Known hiearchies**:

*Note: the hierarchies are found statistically as "$A \rightarrow B$ if B is present in >99% observations with A, and A is present in <99% observations with B" to remove "if and only if" situations.*

1. `5_o_Clock_Shadow` $\rightarrow$ $\lnot$ `No_Beard`
2. `Goatee` $\rightarrow$ $\lnot$ `No_Beard`
3. `5_o_Clock_Shadow` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
4. `Bald` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
5. `Goatee` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
6. `Heavy_Makeup` $\rightarrow$ `No_Beard`
7. `Mustache` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
8. `Rosy_Cheeks` $\rightarrow$ `No_Beard`
9. `Sideburns` $\rightarrow$ `Male`
10. `Wearing_Lipstick` $\rightarrow$ `No_Beard`
11. `Wearing_Necktie` $\rightarrow$ `Male`

**Relevance**: Concepts are well-labelled, so the dataset should be pretty reliable for all concept detection tasks. They're also quite human-readable, since they're all based on objective visual traits such as color or shape. Moreover, it's easy to isolate images containing a particular concept (to later use for CAV computation). 

**Data Gathering & Labelling Methodology**: The data for different species was initially gathered by collecting all images from the Wikipedia site for this species; then, additional images were found through Flickr image search using the Wikipedia pictures as reference. Later, they were filtered and annotated by thousands of workers through Amazon Mechanical Turk website. Multiple workers' responses for the same image were compared against one another to create a single, coherent final label. As a result of this methodology, one should be cautious when using the dataset with pre-trained models, as many of them might have also been trained on the same Flickr images. 

**Known issues**: 
- Images returned by a Flickr query are often a result of one photographer taking many images of the same bird in a very short period of time, so the dataset often contains multiple near-identical images of a given bird. This causes issues with the train-test split: if some of these images are part of the training set, and some are in the test set, this results in a sort of data leakage (nearly identical pictures in training and test set). Thus, it is strongly recommended that we use the train-test split proposed by the authors, which intentionally avoids this issue. 
- There are some spurious correlations between the bird features and the type of background in the pictures - e.g. water birds often appear with a blue water background, while land birds are more often photographed against grass or leaves. Thus, classification models often learn the background instead of the actual bird; this phenomenon was studied by researchers who created the Waterbirds dataset, which artificially changes the background on some pictures to one that's unusual for its bird species ([Sagawa et al., "Distributionally Robust Neural Networks for Group Shifts: On the Importance of Regularization for Worst-Case Generalization"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08731)). 
- Similarly as above, there are also correlations between species and the pose/placement of the bird in the picture (e.g. birds that are easily scared are more often photographed from a distance), which also causes some biases in models ([Branson et al., "Bird Species Categorization Using Pose Normalized Deep Convolutional Nets"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2952)).

- [Jaderberg et al., "Spatial Transformer Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02025): Introduces a Spacial Transformer module, which can be inserted into a neural network architecture and taught to transform the data in the network (so that it becomes invariant to translation, scale, rotation, and more generic warping); it uses CUB-200 to test its performance.

**Link**: [Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 International symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8363547)
 
**Short Description**:
The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) is a global partnership that has organized the world's largest public repository of dermoscopic images of skin lesions annotated with expanded metadata. Their [archive](https://www.isic-archive.com/) has been used for consecutive years to host challenges on skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection. As of today the repository contains 549,571 public images and 1,203,225 in total. 

**Overall volume metrics **: Number of images: 549,571; up to 8 diagnostic groups (depends on edition); up to 80 features for each image (for 2024 edition)

**ISIC Challenges History**

Below is a comprehensive comparison of the major ISIC Challenges over the years. This table provides historical context on how the focus of skin cancer AI research has evolved.

| Year | Primary Dataset Name / Source | Train Images | Diagnostic Scope (Classes) | Key Focus & Historical Innovation |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| **2016** | ISIC Archive Subset | 900 | 2 Classes <br>*(Melanoma vs. All)* | **Proof of Concept:** The inaugural challenge. Focused heavily on basic lesion segmentation and establishing the first standardized baseline for deep learning in dermatology. |
| **2017** | ISIC Archive Subset | 2,000 | 3 Classes <br>*(MEL, NV, SK)* | **Interpretability:** Introduced Dermoscopic Feature Extraction (e.g., detecting *streaks* or *pigment networks*). Pushed for models that could "explain" their reasoning using clinical taxonomy. |

**Classes available in the cited edition**:

| Abbreviation | Full name | Malignant? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| MEL | Melanoma | Yes | Deadliest form of skin cancer; main target for detection |
| NV | Melanocytic Nevus | No | Benign mole; serves as the primary healthy baseline |
| SK | Seborrheic Keratosis | No | Benign non-melanocytic growth; key distractor visually similar to melanoma |

**Challenge Structure (ISIC 2017)**:

The 2017 challenge was structured into three distinct tasks, designed to mimic a dermatologist's step-by-step diagnostic process:

1. **Task 1: Lesion Segmentation**: Generating a binary mask to accurately separate the skin lesion from the surrounding healthy skin and background.
2. **Task 2: Dermoscopic Feature Extraction**: Identifying and localizing specific clinical dermoscopic patterns within the lesion (e.g., *atypical pigment network*, *streaks*, *milia-like cysts*). This was a crucial step towards building interpretable AI models.
3. **Task 3: Disease Classification**: The final diagnostic step. Models had to classify the crop into one of three core categories mentioned above. 

**Known biases**:
1. models tend to predict malignancy based on the presence of surgical skin markings, rulers, or band-aids ([link to paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6694463/))
2. models tend to perform significantly worse on darker skin tones due to extreme dataset imbalance (the vast majority of images are from fair-skinned populations) ([link to paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09640))
3. models tend to rely on image artifacts (like dark corners/vignetting) or background skin rather than the lesion itself, maintaining high accuracy even if the actual lesion is completely masked ([link to paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/ISIC/Bissoto_DeConstructing_Bias_on_Skin_Lesion_Datasets_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf))

### ImageNet + WordNet

*Note: When used like in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11448)*

### ImageNet - content

**Link**: [ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5206848) and the [Official ImageNet Website](https://www.image-net.org/).

![Sample images from ImageNet](https://viso.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ImageNet.jpg)
*Sample images from ImageNet, sourced from viso.ai.*

**Impact**: As of March 2026, the foundational 2009 paper has recorded **93,041 citations** on Google Scholar. The project represents a fundamental shift in AI research, famously summarized by its creator, Fei-Fei Li: 
> *"The paradigm shift of the ImageNet thinking is that while a lot of people are paying attention to models, let’s pay attention to data. Data will redefine how we think about models."*

It established the **ILSVRC** (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge), which served as the definitive benchmark for deep learning progress between 2010 and 2017.

**Short Description**: ImageNet is a large-scale visual ontology based on the **WordNet** lexical structure. It was designed to map the physical world into a structured digital format by associating objects with a hierarchical network of concepts . It pioneered a "data-centric" paradigm, demonstrating that massive scale and taxonomical diversity are essential for developing robust and generalizable visual recognition systems.

**Metrics**: 
* **Total Volume**: 14,197,122 images categorized into 21,841 distinct synsets.
* **ILSVRC Subset**: The most widely used version for model training, focusing on 1,000 selected categories and containing 1,431,167 images
* **Verification**: To remove irrelevant images from a pool of over 160 million candidates, labels were manually verified by over 50,000 workers via Amazon Mechanical Turk.

**Concepts**: 
The dataset is structured using **Synsets** (Sets of Synonyms) from WordNet:
* **Semantic Precision**: Instead of using ambiguous keywords, ImageNet groups synonymous terms into a single synset (e.g., "dog" and "Canis familiaris"). This resolves polysemy, distinguishing between different meanings of the same word, such as "bank" as a financial institution vs. a river bank.
* **Taxonomical Hierarchy**: Concepts are linked via **hypernymy** (is-a relationships). A "Siberian Husky" is nested under "Working Dog," which is under "Dog," and eventually "Mammal." This structure allows for evaluating models based on their hierarchical understanding of categories.

**Relevance**: 
In the context of concept detection and Explainable AI:
1. **Feature Extraction Baseline**: Most models used for Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are pre-trained on ImageNet. Their internal "understanding" of visual concepts is fundamentally shaped by the distribution of these 1,000 categories.
2. **Semantic Error Analysis**: The hierarchy enables the measurement of "semantic distance" - identifying if a model's failure is a fine-grained misclassification (e.g., two similar dog breeds) or a catastrophic semantic error (e.g., mistaking an animal for a vehicle).

**Known biases**:

1. **Geographic and Cultural Skew**: The dataset is heavily biased toward Western, high-income perspectives. Models trained on ImageNet often fail to recognize common objects when they appear in non-Western cultural contexts, such as traditional wedding attire or regional tools. ([link to paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/html/cv4gc/de_Vries_Does_Object_Recognition_Work_for_Everyone_CVPRW_2019_paper.html))
2. **ImageNet Roulette and The Person Subtree**:
The "person" subtree inherited a stagnant WordNet ontology of 2,832 categories, including derogatory and non-visual labels . Due to the low imageability of abstract concepts, models were forced to perform "automated phrenology" by linking physical appearance to social or moral traits . A comprehensive audit removed 1,593 unsafe synsets (600,040 images) and 1,081 non-imageable categories (443,547 images). ([link to paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3351095.3375709))

### MetaShift

**Link**: [MetaShift: A Dataset of Datasets for Evaluating Contextual Distribution Shifts and Training Conflicts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06523)

*Warning: this dataset is not really good in terms of quality*.

### CounterAnimals

#### Overview
**CounterAnimal** is a specialized evaluation dataset introduced in the paper  
[A Sober Look at the Robustness of CLIPs to Spurious Features](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/dd59fad18638714e6c447a3b7b9c4160-Abstract-Conference.html).

The dataset is designed to systematically evaluate the robustness of vision-language models (particularly CLIP) against **spurious correlations**, with a focus on background-dependent biases learned from large-scale web data.

#### Motivation
Traditional robustness benchmarks often exhibit **ImageNet Bias**, meaning they are tailored to older supervised models and fail to capture the weaknesses of modern models like CLIP. Although CLIP appears robust on these benchmarks, such evaluations do not expose the **shortcut learning** behavior induced by web-scale training.

CounterAnimal addresses this gap by providing a dataset explicitly constructed to test whether models rely on **contextual cues (e.g., background)** instead of **object-centric features**.

#### Spurious Correlations
A **spurious correlation** refers to a false association learned by a model between an object and its surrounding context.

- **Example:** A model trained on many images of cows on green grass may learn *"green background → cow"*.
- **Failure Case:** The model fails when presented with a cow on a beach due to the absence of the expected background.

CounterAnimal evaluates whether models truly recognize animals or rely on such contextual shortcuts (e.g., identifying an ice bear only when it appears on snow).

#### Dataset Composition

- **Total Images:** 13,100
- **Number of Classes:** 45 animal classes
- **Source:** Images collected from the iNaturalist platform
- **Class Origin:** Animal categories derived from the ImageNet-1K label set

##### Easy vs. Hard Split
The dataset is divided based on background familiarity:

- **Easy Set:** 7,174 images  
  - Contain animals in typical or commonly associated backgrounds  
  - Example: ice bear on snow  

- **Hard Set:** 5,926 images  
  - Contain animals in atypical or uncommon backgrounds  
  - Example: ice bear on grass  

This split enables direct measurement of performance degradation under background distribution shifts.

#### Dataset Construction Pipeline

The dataset was created using a combination of automated filtering and manual annotation through a four-step process:

##### 1. Data Collection
- Retrieved **300–800 raw images per class** from iNaturalist  
- Queries based on ImageNet-1K animal class names  

##### 2. Data Curation (Manual Cleaning)
Images were manually filtered using the following criteria:

- **Label Noise:** Removal of incorrectly labeled animals  
- **Feature Noise:** Removal of corrupted or broken images  
- **Obscurity:** Removal of images containing multiple animal classes  
- **Clarity:** Removal of images where the animal is heavily occluded or too small  

##### 3. Background Labeling
- Each image was manually annotated with one of **14 background categories**, including:
  - snow
  - grass
  - water

##### 4. Spurious Correlation Discovery
- A CLIP model was used to evaluate sensitivity to background changes:
  - For each class, if altering background conditions led to an **accuracy drop > 5%**, the class was selected
- Images were then categorized into:
  - **Easy:** Backgrounds aligned with learned correlations
  - **Hard:** Backgrounds that break learned correlations

#### Evaluation Protocol

- **Setting:** Zero-shot classification (zero-shot classification is when an AI identifies an object it has never seen before by comparing the image to a written description (like "a photo of a flamingo"))
- **Task:** Identify the correct animal class without task-specific training
- **Label Space:** Typically evaluated over the full **ImageNet-1K categories**
- **Goal:** Measure robustness to background-induced distribution shifts


#### Key Findings from Experiments

##### 1. Generality of Bias
- Significant performance drops (**17–30% or more**) observed across:
  - Different CLIP architectures (e.g., ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14)
  - Different pretraining datasets (e.g., LAION, OpenAI)
- Indicates that spurious correlations are inherent to web-scale training

##### 2. ImageNet Paradox
- Standard ImageNet-trained models outperform CLIP on background-shifted (Hard) samples
- Suggests CLIP relies more heavily on contextual information than traditional models

##### 3. Data Quality vs. Quantity
- Increasing dataset size (e.g., LAION-400M → LAION-2B) does **not** eliminate bias
- High-quality curated datasets (e.g., DataComp, DFN) significantly improve robustness
- Emphasizes importance of **data quality over scale**

##### 4. Model Size Effects
- Larger model architectures show improved robustness
- Suggests increased capacity helps disentangle object features from background context

#### Strategic Conclusions

1. **Distribution Shift Remains Unresolved**  
   Large vision-language models still rely on shortcut learning and have not achieved true semantic understanding.

2. **Need for New Benchmarks**  
   Existing benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating modern models. CounterAnimal provides a targeted tool for diagnosing background bias.

3. **Importance of Data Curation**  
   Robustness depends more on dataset quality and diversity than sheer scale.
